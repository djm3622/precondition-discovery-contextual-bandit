# Preconditioner Discovery via Contextual Bandit Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the implementation for **Preconditioner Discovery via Contextual Bandit Reinforcement Learning**, a method that combines reinforcement learning techniques with contextual bandits to optimize the selection of preconditioners for ill-conditioned systems. This approach is specifically suited for SPD systems arising from 2d diffusion equations, and similar equations.
